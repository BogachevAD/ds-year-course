# ds-year-course
My personal Data Science learning course with focus on Computer Vision. Organized by weeks and modules.

# 📘 DS Year Course

This repository contains my personal **1-year Data Science learning program** with a focus on **Computer Vision**.  
The plan is inspired by MIPT's Data Science program and adapted into a structured roadmap with practical tasks.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Strengthen Python & math foundations for DS
- Learn core libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Gain practical skills in Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Specialize in **Computer Vision** using PyTorch and modern architectures (CNNs, ResNet, YOLO, Transformers)
- Build portfolio projects for freelancing and job applications

## 🗓️ Roadmap
The year is split into modules (weeks), each with theory + practice + mini-projects.  

1. **Foundations** (Python, Git, NumPy, Pandas, Visualization)  
2. **Statistics & Probability**  
3. **Machine Learning** (Scikit-learn)  
4. **Deep Learning** (PyTorch)  
5. **Computer Vision specialization**  
6. **Final projects & portfolio**
